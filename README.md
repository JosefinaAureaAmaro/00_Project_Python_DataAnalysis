 <p><b> Project Topic:</b> Historical Global Air Pollution Trends
 
 Our group's objective for this project was the use our beginner python tools to perform efficent data analysis.</p>
 
 Our motivation behind the topic was derived from our interests as a group.
 To start our analysis, we wanted to answer these questions about Air Pollution and it's potiential causes:
   1. What is the current trend of air pollution?
   2. What is the magnitude of air pollution around the world  in regards metrics reviewed such as, CO2 and PM2.5?
   3. Is air pollution correlated to a country production (GDP) and/or population density?
   4. Once the inital analysis is complete, are there other indicators that we found to have a closely related trend?
 
 Throughout our analysis, each group member created visualizations based on their respective topics.
